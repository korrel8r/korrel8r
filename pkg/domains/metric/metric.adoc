== Object

A link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/common@v0.45.0/model#Metric[Metric] is a time series identified by a label set. Korrel8r does not consider load the sample data for a time series, or use it in rules. If a korrel8r search time constraints, then metrics that have no values that meet the constraint are ignored.

== Query

Query is a link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/[PromQL] query string.

Korrel8r uses metric labels for correlation, it does not use time-series data values. The link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/[PromQL] query is analyzed to identify series it uses, labels of those series are used for correlation.
