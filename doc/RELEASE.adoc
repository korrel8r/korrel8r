= Releasing a new version

Steps to release a new version X.Y.Z, for maintainers.

On branch `main`:

. `make all image VERSION=X.Y.Z IMG_ORG=quay.io/korrel8r` must pass without errors.
. Commit changes (they should only be version related) as 'Release X.Y.Z'
+
NOTE: Normally the only changes in a release commit are `Makefile` and `version.txt`
. `make release VERSION=X.Y.Z IMG_ORG=quay.io/korrel8r` - does the following:
  - Re-run `make all image`
  - Run `hack/tag-release.sh`: check the working tree is clean, create and push the git vX.Y.Z tag.
  - Push a `:latest` tag for the korrel8r image.
